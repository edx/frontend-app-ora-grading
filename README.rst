Purpose
*******

The ORA Staff Grading App is a micro-frontend (MFE) staff grading experience
for Open Response Assessments (ORAs). This experience was designed to
streamline the grading process and enable richer previews of submission content
and, eventually, replace on-platform grading workflows for ORA.

When enabled, ORAs with a staff grading step will link to this new MFE when
clicking "Grade Available Responses" from the ORA or link in the instructor
dashboard.

The ORA Staff Grader depends on the `lms/djangoapps/ora_staff_grader
<https://github.com/openedx/edx-platform/tree/master/lms/djangoapps/ora_staff_grader>`_
app in ``edx-platform``.

Getting Started
***************

Developing
==========

One Time Setup
--------------

First, clone the repo, install code prerequisites, and start the app.

.. code-block::

  # Clone the repository
  git clone git@github.com:openedx/frontend-app-ora-grading.git
  cd frontend-app-ora-grading

  # Install prerequisites
  npm install

  # Start the MFE
  npm run start

The app will, by default, run on `http://localhost:1993` unless otherwise
specified in ``.env.development:PORT`` and ``.env.development:BASE_URL``.

Next, enable the ORA Grading micro-frontend in `edx-platform`

#. Add the path to the ORA Grading app in `edx-platform`:

   #. Go to your environment settings (e.g. `edx-platform/lms/envs/private.py`)

   #. Add the environment variable, ``ORA_GRADING_MICROFRONTEND_URL`` pointing
      to the ORA Grading app location (e.g. ``http://localhost:1993``).

#. Start / restart the ``edx-platform`` ``lms``.

#. Enable the ORA Grading feature in Django Admin.

   #. Go to Django Admin (`{lms-root}/admin`)

   #. Navigate to ``django-waffle`` > ``Flags`` and click ``add/enable a new
      flag``.

   #. Add a new flag called ``openresponseassessment.enhanced_staff_grader``
      and enable it.

From there, visit an Open Response Assessment with a Staff Graded Step and
click the "View and grade responses" button to begin grading in the ORA Staff
Grader experience.
